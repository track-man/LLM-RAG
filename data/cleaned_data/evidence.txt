When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney , Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten - hour flight back to Los Angeles , which the team ( including Saito , who wants to verify their success ) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream . At each dream level , the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a ' kick ' that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level ; to be successful , these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level , a fact complicated due to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level . The first level is Yusuf 's dream of a rainy Los Angeles . The team abducts Fischer , but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer 's subconscious , which has been specifically trained to defend him against such intruders . The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse , where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up , the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi - level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into ' limbo ' , a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult , if not almost impossible , and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream . Despite these setbacks , the team continues with the mission .

Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream - sharing technology . Sedated for a few hours of real time , they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories . When Mal refused to return to reality , Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem ( an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality ) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real . However , when she woke up , Mal still believed that she was dreaming . In an attempt to ' wake up ' for real , Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same . Facing a murder charge , Cobb fled the U.S. , leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles .

When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney , Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten - hour flight back to Los Angeles , which the team ( including Saito , who wants to verify their success ) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream . At each dream level , the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a ' kick ' that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level ; to be successful , these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level , a fact complicated due to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level . The first level is Yusuf 's dream of a rainy Los Angeles . The team abducts Fischer , but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer 's subconscious , which has been specifically trained to defend him against such intruders . The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse , where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up , the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi - level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into ' limbo ' , a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult , if not almost impossible , and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream . Despite these setbacks , the team continues with the mission .

Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream - sharing technology . Sedated for a few hours of real time , they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories . When Mal refused to return to reality , Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem ( an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality ) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real . However , when she woke up , Mal still believed that she was dreaming . In an attempt to ' wake up ' for real , Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same . Facing a murder charge , Cobb fled the U.S. , leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles .

Through his confession , Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal 's death . Ariadne kills Mal 's projection and wakes Fischer up with a kick . Revived at the mountain hospital , Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea : a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man . While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito , the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality . Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement . The dreamers all awake on the plane and Saito makes a phone call . Upon arrival at Los Angeles Airport , Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home . Using his totem a spinning top that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality Cobb conducts a test to prove that he is indeed in the real world , but he ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden .

Fish are gill - bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits . They form a sister group to the tunicates , together forming the olfactores . Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups . Tetrapods emerged within lobe - finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well . However , traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods ( i.e. , the amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry ) . Because in this manner the term " fish " is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group , it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology , unless it is used in the cladistic sense , including tetrapods . The traditional term pisces ( also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification .   "fun_facts": [

William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the " Bard of Avon " . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period .        "fun_facts": [
          "Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\u201d",
          "Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.",
          "Polish composer Andr\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick. In 2008, the skull was used in a series of performances of Hamlet at the Courtyard Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.",
          "Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.",
          "Shakespeare's works take on a different meaning when performed with an era-appropriate accent instead of a modern one, often introducing rhymes or puns that don't work in modern pronunciations."

William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the " Bard of Avon " . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith .

Fish are gill - bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits . They form a sister group to the tunicates , together forming the olfactores . Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups . Tetrapods emerged within lobe - finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well . However , traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods ( i.e. , the amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry ) . Because in this manner the term " fish " is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group , it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology , unless it is used in the cladistic sense , including tetrapods . The traditional term pisces ( also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification ."fun_facts": [

 Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography , by its repertoire of movements , or by its historical period or place of origin . 
 An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance , although these two categories are not always completely separate ; both may have special functions , whether social , ceremonial , competitive , erotic , martial , or sacred / liturgical . 
 Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance - like quality , including martial arts , gymnastics , cheerleading , figure skating , synchronized swimming , marching bands , and many other forms of athletics ."fun_facts": [

William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the " Bard of Avon " . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period ."fun_facts": [

A comic book or comicbook , also called comic magazine or simply comic , is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes . Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative , usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form . Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan , comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s . The first modern comic book , Famous Funnies , was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips , which had established many of the story - telling devices used in comics . The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone ; however , this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres , usually not humorous in tone .

The Universe is all of space and time and their contents , including planets , stars , galaxies , and all other forms of matter and energy . 
 Under this theory , space and time emerged together 13.799±0.021 billion years ago with a fixed amount of energy and matter that has become less dense as the Universe has expanded . 
 Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense , forming the first galaxies , stars , and everything else seen today . 
 Stars , planets , and visible gas clouds only form about 6 % of ordinary matter , or about 0.3 % of the entire universe . There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what , if anything , preceded the Big Bang , while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate , doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible ."fun_facts": [

A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity , is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion , and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals . The term planet is ancient , with ties to history , astrology , science , mythology , and religion . Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye . These were regarded by many early cultures as divine , or as emissaries of deities . As scientific knowledge advanced , human perception of the planets changed , incorporating a number of disparate objects . In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System . This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit . Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain " planets " under the modern definition , some celestial bodies , such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta ( each an object in the solar asteroid belt ) , and Pluto ( the first trans - Neptunian object discovered ) , that were once considered planets by the scientific community , are no longer viewed as such .

A comic book or comicbook , also called comic magazine or simply comic , is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes . Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative , usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form . Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan , comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s . The first modern comic book , Famous Funnies , was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips , which had established many of the story - telling devices used in comics . The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone ; however , this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres , usually not humorous in tone ."fun_facts": [

Alden Ehrenreich plays a young Han Solo and Joonas Suotamo is Chewbacca in " Solo : A Star Wars Story . " ( Jonathan Olley / Lucasfilm Ltd. ) It 's shaping up to be a summer of heroes . Summer movies often include a few . Remember last year 's " Wonder Woman " and " Captain Underpants " ? This summer is packed with heroes - of the real - life , animated and even animal - like varieties . It would be easy to get hero overload . So we 've chosen half a dozen movies that let you enjoy the hero 's journey at a -regular - kid pace . Star Wars " Solo : A Star Wars Story " ( Opens May 25 , PG-13 ) Perhaps the most beloved " Star Wars " character - played by Harrison Ford in four movies - gets his own film . The story explores how a young Han Solo ( Alden Ehrenreich ) teams up with furry sidekick Chewbacca and earns his reputation as a smuggler and pilot who thinks highly of himself . Trailers promise plenty of high - speed chases and blaster battles . The gamble is whether fans want a second actor for a Solo character .
