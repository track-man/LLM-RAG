Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it . That 's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film . But it 's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one . director : Steven Spielberg genre : Historical , Political introduction : The Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer . It stars Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham , the first female publisher of a major American newspaper , and Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee , the executive editor of The Washington Post , with Sarah Paulson , Bob Odenkirk , Tracy Letts , Bradley Whitford , Bruce Greenwood , Carrie Coon , and Matthew Rhys in supporting roles . Set in the early 1970s , The Post depicts the true story of attempts by journalists at The Washington Post to publish the Pentagon Papers , classified documents regarding the 30 - year involvement of the United States government in the Vietnam War . movieName : The Post rating : Rotten Tomatoes : 88 % and average : 7.9/10 Metacritic Score : 83/100 CinemaScore : A year : 2017",

At each dream level , the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a ' kick ' that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level ; to be successful , these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level , a fact complicated due to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level . The first level is Yusuf 's dream of a rainy Los Angeles . The team abducts Fischer , but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer 's subconscious , which has been specifically trained to defend him against such intruders . The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse , where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up , the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi - level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into ' limbo ' , a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult , if not almost impossible , and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream . Despite these setbacks , the team continues with the mission .",

    "context": "A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity , is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion , and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals . The term planet is ancient , with ties to history , astrology , science , mythology , and religion . Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye . These were regarded by many early cultures as divine , or as emissaries of deities . As scientific knowledge advanced , human perception of the planets changed , incorporating a number of disparate objects . In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System . This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit . Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \" planets \" under the modern definition , some celestial bodies , such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta ( each an object in the solar asteroid belt ) , and Pluto ( the first trans - Neptunian object discovered ) , that were once considered planets by the scientific community , are no longer viewed as such .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun\", \"The planet Venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons. It is the only planet that rotates clock-wise.\", \"there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree Fahrenheit weather.\", \"astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system some 455 light-years away\", \"the planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and \\\"rolls\\\" around the sun rather than \\\"spinning\\\" like the other planets.\" ]",

Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it . That 's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film . But it 's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one . director : Steven Spielberg genre : Historical , Political introduction : The Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer . It stars Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham , the first female publisher of a major American newspaper , and Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee , the executive editor of The Washington Post , with Sarah Paulson , Bob Odenkirk , Tracy Letts , Bradley Whitford , Bruce Greenwood , Carrie Coon , and Matthew Rhys in supporting roles . Set in the early 1970s , The Post depicts the true story of attempts by journalists at The Washington Post to publish the Pentagon Papers , classified documents regarding the 30 - year involvement of the United States government in the Vietnam War . movieName : The Post rating : Rotten Tomatoes : 88 % and average : 7.9/10 Metacritic Score : 83/100 CinemaScore : A year : 2017",

    "context": "William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick.

Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it . That 's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film . But it 's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one . director : Steven Spielberg genre : Historical , Political introduction : The Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer . It stars Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham , the first female publisher of a major American newspaper , and Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee , the executive editor of The Washington Post , with Sarah Paulson , Bob Odenkirk , Tracy Letts , Bradley Whitford , Bruce Greenwood , Carrie Coon , and Matthew Rhys in supporting roles . Set in the early 1970s , The Post depicts the true story of attempts by journalists at The Washington Post to publish the Pentagon Papers , classified documents regarding the 30 - year involvement of the United States government in the Vietnam War . movieName : The Post rating : Rotten Tomatoes : 88 % and average : 7.9/10 Metacritic Score : 83/100 CinemaScore : A year : 2017",

Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups . Tetrapods emerged within lobe - finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well . However , traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods ( i.e. , the amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry ) . Because in this manner the term \" fish \" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group , it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology , unless it is used in the cladistic sense , including tetrapods . The traditional term pisces ( also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification .\"fun_facts\": [ \"There is a deep-water fish called the Black Swallower (or great swallower) that can swallow whole fish twice its length and up to ten times it mass.\", \"freshwater fish only \\\"drink\\\" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths\", \"a Seahorse is the only fish to have a neck\", \"there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal\", \"84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish\" ]",
