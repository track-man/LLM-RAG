Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it . That 's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film . But it 's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one . director : Steven Spielberg genre : Historical , Political introduction : The Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer . It stars Meryl Streep as Katharine Graham , the first female publisher of a major American newspaper , and Tom Hanks as Ben Bradlee , the executive editor of The Washington Post , with Sarah Paulson , Bob Odenkirk , Tracy Letts , Bradley Whitford , Bruce Greenwood , Carrie Coon , and Matthew Rhys in supporting roles .

Dogs vary widely in shape , size and colors .

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice.

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later .

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick. In 2008, the skull was used in a series of performances of Hamlet at the Courtyard Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.\", \"Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.\", \"Shakespeare's works take on a different meaning when performed with an era-appropriate accent instead of a modern one, often introducing rhymes or puns that don't work in modern pronunciations.\" ]",

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick.

Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan , comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s . The first modern comic book , Famous Funnies , was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips , which had established many of the story - telling devices used in comics . The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone ; however , this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres , usually not humorous in tone .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Comic book legend Stan Lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word \\\"Excelsior!\\\"\", \"the Marvel Cinematic Universe takes place in Earth-199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book universe, Earth-616.\", \"Marvel published a \\\"Generic Comic Book\\\", in order to trademark the names \\\"Super-Hero\\\" and \\\"Super-Villain\\\"\", \"the DC from DC Comics stands for Detective Comics, so their company name is redundant.\", \"the Michigan State University Library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world\" ]",

    "context": "Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times , it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations , performed by Galileo Galilei . As observational tools improved , astronomers saw that , like Earth , each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole , and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons . On December 20 , 2011 , the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth - sized extrasolar planets , Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f , orbiting a Sun - like star , Kepler-20 . A 2012 study , analyzing gravitational microlensing data , estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way . Around one in five Sun - like stars is thought to have an Earth - sized planet in its habitable zone . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun\", \"The planet Venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons. It is the only planet that rotates clock-wise.\", \"there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree Fahrenheit weather.\", \"astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system some 455 light-years away\", \"the planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and \\\"rolls\\\" around the sun rather than \\\"spinning\\\" like the other planets.\" ]",

Summer movies often include a few . Remember last year 's \" Wonder Woman \" and \" Captain Underpants \" ? This summer is packed with heroes - of the real - life , animated and even animal - like varieties . It would be easy to get hero overload . So we 've chosen half a dozen movies that let you enjoy the hero 's journey at a -regular - kid pace . Star Wars \" Solo : A Star Wars Story \" ( Opens May 25 , PG-13 ) Perhaps the most beloved \" Star Wars \" character - played by Harrison Ford in four movies - gets his own film . The story explores how a young Han Solo ( Alden Ehrenreich ) teams up with furry sidekick Chewbacca and earns his reputation as a smuggler and pilot who thinks highly of himself . Trailers promise plenty of high - speed chases and blaster battles . The gamble is whether fans want a second actor for a Solo character .",

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick. In 2008, the skull was used in a series of performances of Hamlet at the Courtyard Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.\", \"Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.\", \"Shakespeare's works take on a different meaning when performed with an era-appropriate accent instead of a modern one, often introducing rhymes or puns that don't work in modern pronunciations.\" ]",

Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it . That 's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film . But it 's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one . director : Steven Spielberg genre : Historical , Political introduction : The Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer .

The saga quickly became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon . \\n The first film was followed by two successful sequels , The Empire Strikes Back ( 1980 ) and Return of the Jedi ( 1983 ) ; these three films constitute the original Star Wars trilogy . A prequel trilogy was released between 1999 and 2005 , albeit to mixed reactions from critics and fans . Finally , a sequel trilogy to conclude the nine - episode saga began in 2015 with The Force Awakens . The first eight films were nominated for Academy Awards ( with wins going to the first two released ) and were commercially successful , with a combined box office revenue of over US$ 8.5 billion . Together with the theatrical spin - off films The Clone Wars ( 2008 ) , Rogue One ( 2016 ) , and Solo : A Star Wars Story ( 2018 ) , Star Wars is the second - highest - grossing film series of all time .

Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan , comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s . The first modern comic book , Famous Funnies , was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips , which had established many of the story - telling devices used in comics . The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone ; however , this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres , usually not humorous in tone .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Comic book legend Stan Lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word \\\"Excelsior!\\\"\", \"the Marvel Cinematic Universe takes place in Earth-199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book universe, Earth-616.\", \"Marvel published a \\\"Generic Comic Book\\\", in order to trademark the names \\\"Super-Hero\\\" and \\\"Super-Villain\\\"\", \"the DC from DC Comics stands for Detective Comics, so their company name is redundant.\", \"the Michigan State University Library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world\" ]",

As observational tools improved , astronomers saw that , like Earth , each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole , and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons . On December 20 , 2011 , the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth - sized extrasolar planets , Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f , orbiting a Sun - like star , Kepler-20 . A 2012 study , analyzing gravitational microlensing data , estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way . Around one in five Sun - like stars is thought to have an Earth - sized planet in its habitable zone . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun\", \"The planet Venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons. It is the only planet that rotates clock-wise.\", \"there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree Fahrenheit weather.\", \"astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system some 455 light-years away\", \"the planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and \\\"rolls\\\" around the sun rather than \\\"spinning\\\" like the other planets.\" ]",

Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it . That 's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film . But it 's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one . director : Steven Spielberg genre : Historical , Political introduction : The Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer .

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick. In 2008, the skull was used in a series of performances of Hamlet at the Courtyard Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.\", \"Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.\", \"Shakespeare's works take on a different meaning when performed with an era-appropriate accent instead of a modern one, often introducing rhymes or puns that don't work in modern pronunciations.\" ]",

He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick.

On December 20 , 2011 , the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth - sized extrasolar planets , Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f , orbiting a Sun - like star , Kepler-20 . A 2012 study , analyzing gravitational microlensing data , estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way . Around one in five Sun - like stars is thought to have an Earth - sized planet in its habitable zone .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun\", \"The planet Venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons.

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today.

The term planet is ancient , with ties to history , astrology , science , mythology , and religion . Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye . These were regarded by many early cultures as divine , or as emissaries of deities . As scientific knowledge advanced , human perception of the planets changed , incorporating a number of disparate objects . In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System . This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit . Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \" planets \" under the modern definition , some celestial bodies , such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta ( each an object in the solar asteroid belt ) , and Pluto ( the first trans - Neptunian object discovered ) , that were once considered planets by the scientific community , are no longer viewed as such . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun\", \"The planet Venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons.

The term planet is ancient , with ties to history , astrology , science , mythology , and religion . Five planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye . These were regarded by many early cultures as divine , or as emissaries of deities . As scientific knowledge advanced , human perception of the planets changed , incorporating a number of disparate objects . In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System . This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit . Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \" planets \" under the modern definition , some celestial bodies , such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta ( each an object in the solar asteroid belt ) , and Pluto ( the first trans - Neptunian object discovered ) , that were once considered planets by the scientific community , are no longer viewed as such . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the Sun\", \"The planet Venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons. It is the only planet that rotates clock-wise.\", \"there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree Fahrenheit weather.\", \"astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system some 455 light-years away\", \"the planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and \\\"rolls\\\" around the sun rather than \\\"spinning\\\" like the other planets.\" ]",

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick.
