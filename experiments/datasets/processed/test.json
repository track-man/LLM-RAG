Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it . That 's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film . But it 's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one . director : Steven Spielberg genre : Historical , Political introduction : The Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer .

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick. In 2008, the skull was used in a series of performances of Hamlet at the Courtyard Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.\", \"Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.\", \"Shakespeare's works take on a different meaning when performed with an era-appropriate accent instead of a modern one, often introducing rhymes or puns that don't work in modern pronunciations.\" ]",

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice. Full circle.\\u201d\", \"Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.\", \"Polish composer Andr\\u00e9 Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as a prop for the skull of Yorick.

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice.

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period . \"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today. Some of these include: \\u201cGood riddance. In my heart of hearts. Laughing stock. Wild-goose chase. Devil incarnate. Brave new world. As luck would have it. All our yesterdays. Break the ice.

Nobody needs to be reminded that history tends to go in circles , but The Post is so vital because it captures the ecstasy of trying to break the chain and bend things towards justice ; defending the fundamental tenets of the Constitution has n't been this much fun since Hamilton . has all the makings of an awards season hit , but is too calculated to reflect today 's ragged , tenuous sociopolitical climate . Spielberg makes these crucial days in American history easy to follow . But if you look at The Post next to something like All the President 's Men , you see the difference between having a story passively explained to you and actively helping to untangle it . That 's a small quibble with an urgent and impeccably acted film . But it 's also the difference between a very good movie and a great one . director : Steven Spielberg genre : Historical , Political introduction : The Post is a 2017 American historical political thriller film directed and produced by Steven Spielberg and written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer .

It is cocksure , impatient , cold , exciting and instinctively perceptive . The Social Network is the movie of the year . But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further . Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness , they define the dark irony of the past decade . The biographical part takes liberties with its subject . Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on a contentious book , Ben Mezrich 's The Accidental Billionaires , so everything that 's seen is n't necessarily to be believed . director : David Fincher genre : Biographical , drama introduction : The Social Network is a 2010 American biographical drama film directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin .
