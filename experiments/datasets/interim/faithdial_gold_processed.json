It is cocksure , impatient , cold , exciting and instinctively perceptive . The Social Network is the movie of the year . But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further . Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness , they define the dark irony of the past decade . The biographical part takes liberties with its subject . Aaron Sorkin based his screenplay on a contentious book , Ben Mezrich 's The Accidental Billionaires , so everything that 's seen is n't necessarily to be believed . director : David Fincher genre : Biographical , drama introduction : The Social Network is a 2010 American biographical drama film directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin . Adapted from Ben Mezrich 's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires : The Founding of Facebook , A Tale of Sex , Money , Genius and Betrayal , the film portrays the founding of social networking website Facebook and the resulting lawsuits . It stars Jesse Eisenberg as founder Mark Zuckerberg , along with Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin , Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker , and Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss . Neither Zuckerberg nor any other Facebook staff were involved with the project , although Saverin was a consultant for Mezrich 's book.[3 ] The film was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on October 1 , 2010 . movieName : The Social Network rating : Rotten Tomatoes : 96 % and average : 9/10 Metacritic Score : 95/100 CinemaScore : B+ year : 2010",

At each dream level , the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a ' kick ' that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level ; to be successful , these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level , a fact complicated due to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level . The first level is Yusuf 's dream of a rainy Los Angeles . The team abducts Fischer , but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer 's subconscious , which has been specifically trained to defend him against such intruders . The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse , where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up , the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi - level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into ' limbo ' , a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult , if not almost impossible , and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream . Despite these setbacks , the team continues with the mission .",

Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups . Tetrapods emerged within lobe - finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well .

    "context": "William Shakespeare ( bapt . 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616 ) was an English poet , playwright and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's greatest dramatist . He is often called England 's national poet and the \" Bard of Avon \" . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 39 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part - owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . At age 49 ( around 1613 ) , he appears to have retired to Stratford , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive ; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , his sexuality , his religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others . Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Shakespeare coined or popularized many of the phrases we use today.

    "context": "A comic book or comicbook , also called comic magazine or simply comic , is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes . Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative , usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form . Although comics has some origins in 18th century Japan , comic books were first popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s . The first modern comic book , Famous Funnies , was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips , which had established many of the story - telling devices used in comics . The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone ; however , this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres , usually not humorous in tone .\"fun_facts\": [ \"Comic book legend Stan Lee ends every phone conversation he has with the word \\\"Excelsior!\\\"\", \"the Marvel Cinematic Universe takes place in Earth-199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book universe, Earth-616.\", \"Marvel published a \\\"Generic Comic Book\\\", in order to trademark the names \\\"Super-Hero\\\" and \\\"Super-Villain\\\"\", \"the DC from DC Comics stands for Detective Comics, so their company name is redundant.\", \"the Michigan State University Library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world\" ]",

Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense , forming the first galaxies , stars , and everything else seen today . Stars , planets , and visible gas clouds only form about 6 % of ordinary matter , or about 0.3 % of the entire universe .

Included in this definition are the living hagfish , lampreys , and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups . Tetrapods emerged within lobe - finned fishes , so cladistically they are fish as well . However , traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods ( i.e. , the amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry ) . Because in this manner the term \" fish \" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group , it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology , unless it is used in the cladistic sense , including tetrapods . The traditional term pisces ( also ichthyes ) is considered a typological , but not a phylogenetic classification .\"fun_facts\": [ \"There is a deep-water fish called the Black Swallower (or great swallower) that can swallow whole fish twice its length and up to ten times it mass.\", \"freshwater fish only \\\"drink\\\" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths\", \"a Seahorse is the only fish to have a neck\", \"there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal\", \"84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish\" ]",
